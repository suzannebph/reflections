1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates a git metadata to track the changes in your repository.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

Working directory - your local copy
Repository - repository in Git/CLoud
Staging area - area in between your repository and working directory where you
can temporarily add your changes.

It offers ability to see a snapshot of all your changes from the files on the
repository and your working directory. Additionally, it offers a temporary
place for these changes so in case you want to remove them, you can do so.

3. How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per
logical change?

Add all the files/changes for one logical change to the staging area as you go
along. Commit when all the needed changes for that logical change is done.
