1. When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If you want to share it to other people or you want a backup of your repository.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

So you can control when you want to introduce the changes made by other people
to your local repository. Maybe you want to finish all your modifications
first so you don't want to introduce the new changes first. Or maybe you found
a bug so you want to check if it's already fixed by others in the remote
repository.
