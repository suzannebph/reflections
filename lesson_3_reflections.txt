1. When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If you want to share it to other people or you want a backup of your repository.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

So you can control when you want to introduce the changes made by other people
to your local repository. Maybe you want to finish all your modifications
first so you don't want to introduce the new changes first. Or maybe you found
a bug so you want to check if it's already fixed by others in the remote
repository.

3. Describe the difference between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?

Branches - a different branch of your local repository that might include some
changes from the master. You'll use this if you just want to add a new feature
or makes some changes that you want to branch away from your main code.
Clones - a copy of the whole repository in your local. This may include one or
more branches. You'll use this if you want a local copy of a remote repository
or you want to keep your original repository intact and you're drastically
modifying your code.
Forks - a copy of your remote repository (or a clone of a repository in
GitHub). You use this if you want to keep a remote copy of your repository
intact. 

4. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

You can work offline.
